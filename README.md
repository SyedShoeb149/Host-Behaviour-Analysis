This repository contains an analysis of host behavior in the hospitality industry, focusing on the differences in behavior and performance between super hosts and other hosts. The study utilized a dataset comprising both super hosts and non-super hosts to identify key distinctions in their performance and behaviors.
# Project Highlights
* Performance Metrics: Various performance metrics, including ratings, response times, and bookings, were utilized to compare the behavior and performance of super hosts and other hosts.
* Data Analysis Techniques: Data extraction, transformation, and visualization techniques were employed using SQL and Excel to analyze and present the dataset effectively.
* Key Findings: The analysis identified significant differences in behavior between super hosts and other hosts. Super hosts exhibited higher ratings, more bookings, and faster response times compared to non-super hosts.
* Insights and Recommendations: The project generated valuable insights into areas where non-super hosts can improve their performance. These insights include suggestions such as enhancing response times and the quality of their listings.
